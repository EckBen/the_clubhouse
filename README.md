# The Clubhouse

## What
This web app is a mock social media application. It leverages Ruby on Rails with several gems (i.e Devise, Simple_form, Bulma) to allow user registration, basic CRUD for commenting and posting, and tagging.

## Why
I created this in response to a Project prompt from The Odin Project. I decided to go a little above and beyond to test and push myself beyond what I felt ready for.
